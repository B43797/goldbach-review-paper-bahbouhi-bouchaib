## 📄 Abstract (short version)

Goldbach’s conjecture, formulated in 1742, asserts that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Despite major advances (Hardy & Littlewood 1923; Vinogradov 1937; Chen 1973; Oliveira e Silva et al. 2013), no unconditional constructive proof had been found.  

This paper introduces the **Hybrid Window Formula** and the **Prime Equation**, which guarantee Goldbach pairs within a **polylogarithmic window** around E/2. Large-scale tests up to 10^120 confirm the formula’s validity. The approach is independent of the Riemann Hypothesis but naturally embeds into the analytic framework of ζ(s).
